### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on):

Make sure to stretch/take pom's frequently. Turning off distractions. If distractions do take place, maybe that's a sign for a pom. 

When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could interfere with your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those issues? (Examples: my kids, my dog, my partner, etc.)

Working with while roommates are present, ability to be attentive and limit distractions. Imporatance of Poms. 

If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype)
Slack app on the phone for daily communication if wifi is down/slow. 

Communicate through slack on our mobile device. Changes to code can be done without internet through atom, then push/pull once reconnected. Continuous line of communication. 

* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?

30 minutes on, 5 to 7 minutes off, but not a steadfast rule based on how we are feeling. Establish a firm cutoff if we haven't pom'd in an hour. 

* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?

Dedicate time to just talking about our general quality of life. All conversations does not have to revolve around code. 

### Project: What's Cookin'? 

Group Member Names: 
Alex Eickelman 
Collin Kallery

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

Better understanding of writing tests.
Stronger grasp of different array prototypes and their syntax. 
Implementing ES6 syntax. 
Feeling better with class interactions and knowing when to use dot notation as opposed to bracket. 
Reinforce html/css skills.

Work Styles:

Find a balance between screen sharing,driver-navigator, divide and conquer to make sure everything is done effeciently and we are both on the same page.
Take poms often
Take advantage of given work time. 
Cutoff for paired working around 6ish. Can always do solo work later if necessary. 
Prioritize planning and pseudo coding. Actually writing the code is the final step. 


Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):

Finishing paired work around 6 or 7pm. Saturdays, morning/part of afternoon should be free for 'real-life' activities. Schedule pull requests so that we are starting each day on the same master

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):

Direct and honest feedback. Respect each others opinion, work on a consesus basis. Not be afraid of merge conflicts, look at is as an opportunity to improve our code review skills. 
Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
Not being content with 'okay' code. Look for refactor opportunities. 
Be able to deal with frustration is a healthy manner. Not letting a simple bug get to us, ruin our day. 

Decision Making:
Daily communication should be a top priority. Make decisions on a consensus basis, pull requests should have input from both collaborators. 

How to do our best work:

(Alex) limit distractions
(Collie) communication throughout the day.


Technical strengths for this project:

Ability to reach out to others when things aren't working properly. 
Ability to write methods within classes.
Communication between two different classes. 

How to approach bugs:

Prioritize psuedo coding and approaching it from a human perspective to look at the big picture away from the symantics of code. 


How to know if a project is successful:

Having an application that can be successfully navigated as a user. Establishing a solid MVP, set goals for 4's and 3's in the rubric. 
If you have time to refactor, it shows that planning and implementation was successful. 

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):

GitHub projects, GitHub Pages for deployment, GitHub for the house the code. 

Day 1 Agenda: 

-Create general class structure and base understanding of what each class does and its interactions with other classes.
-Begin testing for User and Recipe.
