# What's Cookin'?

The What's Cookin'? Project is a paired project for Front End Module 2 students at the Turing School of Software and Design. The idea behind the project was to build a site in which users can view recipes, add recipes to cook, view their favorite recipes, and generate a shopping list based on ingredients needed. The main goals of this project were to structure code progression based around Test Driven Design, ES6 classes, and have functions and methods utilize a Singular Responsibility Principal.
